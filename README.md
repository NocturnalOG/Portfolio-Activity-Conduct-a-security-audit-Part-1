# The start of Portfolio Activity 1: Conduct a security audit
## This is for coursera, Google Cybersecurity Certification

In this introduction of a project we will be assessing & reviewing a scenario for a company whose online marketplace presence has grown larger. 
With the increase of this company the IT manager has decided that a security audit is needed so we can enhance the plan of action, adhere to all regulatory frameworks & overall ensure the strength of the IT department and its security.

Scope
- Overview of all current user permissions in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrustion detection system, SIEM tools

Goals
- Adhere to the NIST CSF, fortify system controls, establish better process & polocies for their systems and playbook, ensure they're meeting compliance

# Risk assessment

After reviewing the risk assessment some of the biggest risks of the organization are as follows:
- Does not adhere to compliance with U.S. and international regulations |high priority|
- Internal network & internet access are being mismanaged and need a standard set of guidelines |high priority|
- Employee equipment & badge readers need to be overhauled and secured |high priority|

# Conduct the audit: Control assessment 
- Administrative Controls
  -  Access control policies, least privilege & seperation of duties all need to be implemented at the highest priority |Needs to be implemented|
  -  Disaster recovery plans should be next on the list to ensure everyone knows what must be done during times of trouble |Needs to be implemented|
  -  Password policies & account management are still incredibly important but will be strengthened by assuring the higher priority items are handled first |Needs to be implemented|
- Technical Controls
  - Firewall, antivirus, intrustion detection system and encryption should all be worked on and implemented at the highest priority to ensure that the foundation of a secure network that's handling PII is heavily reinforced to deter from any and all threat actors |Needs to be implemented|
  - Manual monitoring, maintenance and intervention of legacy systems should be on high priority due to the systems being older which could mean more exploitation and requires an employee to be present; proper training and understanding of tools will greatly help mitigate any risks that may occur |Needs to be implemented|
  - Backups and password management while they are important, should be at medium priority due to more serious foundational problems within the company
- Physical Controls
  - CCTV, fire detection and prevention, along with locks are all highest priority that will greatly secure the physical location and protect it from worst case scenarios |Needs to be implemented|
  - Locking cabinets, time-controlled safe & adequate lighting would be next highest priorities that help lockdown the physical location even more and keep even less individuals from having access to important, or keep people from being hidden |Needs to be implemented|
  - Signage indicating a security system isn't of the highest priority, while it can help make criminals think twice, a sign doesn't physically stop anyone from causing harm |Does not need implementation|

# Compliance Checklist
Since we are a business that conducts transactions not only at a physical location but in an online marketplace we need to adhere to mandatory regulations of the following policies:
- General Data Protection Regulation: Since we will be handling the data of individuals from across the globe it is within our upmost importance to ensure that E.U. regulations are followed ensuring that their citizens are receiving protection on all fronts
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Like with any business transactions will most commonly involve using some form of payment card and within that card is a multitude of extremely sensitive data that needs to be in secure environments only
- System and Organizations Controls: This is our baseline of ensuring that we as a company are following our own policies and procedures, while also following all compliance at all levels, on-top of all this we must make sure our framework matches that of CIA and just general overall data safety.
